# A-simple-WebScraping-Project

Using the Selenium library, I was able to successfully extract ETF data from the website: 'https://www.etf.com/etfanalytics/etf-finder', and store it in a dataframe using the Pandas library.

Selenium is a powerful tool for web scraping and automation. It provides a way to control web browsers programmatically, allowing you to interact with web pages, fill out forms, and extract data. In this case, I utilized Selenium to navigate to the ETF Finder page on the ETF.com website and retrieve the data.

After extracting the data, I used the Pandas library to create a dataframe, which is a tabular data structure that allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data. The dataframe provides a convenient way to store the ETF data in a structured format with labeled columns.

By combining the capabilities of Selenium and Pandas, I was able to automate the process of data extraction from the ETF.com website and organize it in a dataframe for further analysis. This approach enables efficient data collection and empowers data-driven decision making in the domain of ETF analytics.
